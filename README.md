# 3D-Vector-Calculus
> Internal Assessment for IB Mathematics Analysis & Approaches Higher Level (class of 2022) regarding 3D vectors and calculus to find how fast a camera should rotate to record a zipliner as they ascend in the center of the frame. 

Check out the PDF "FINAL_MATH_IA_SUBMITTED" for the full report! The following is a quick sneak peak for what the investigation includes.
